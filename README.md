# Detecting Signatures of Natural Selection in Butterfly Genomes (anynana)

This project aims to detect signals of natural selection—including both positive and balancing selection—in the genomes of the butterfly species *Bicyclus anynana*.    By leveraging population genetic statistics and high-throughput sequencing data, we identify genomic regions potentially under selection.

## Project Goals
Analyze whole-genome resequencing data from multiple *Bicyclus anynana* individuals.
Compute population genetic statistics such as nucleotide diversity (π), Tajima’s D.


## Tools and Technologies

This project relies on high-performance computing (HPC) and several bioinformatics tools, including:
R (for visualization and statistical analysis)
BWA (sequence alignment)
SAMtools / BCFtools (variant calling and filtering)
ANGSD (SFS and theta statistics)
BEDTools (coverage analysis)
SGE (HPC job submission)
